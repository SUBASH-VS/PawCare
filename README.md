# PAWCARE
**PAWCARE** is inspired by the need for a more accessible and efficient pet adoption platform. The project seeks to streamline the adoption process by offering users a comprehensive database of adoptable pets with detailed information on each animal's age, gender, breed, and background. The application allows users to register, explore pet profiles, and initiate the adoption process.
		Administered by authorized personnel, the platform enables efficient management of pet details, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information. PAWCARE leverages smart technology to suggest optimal pet matches based on user preferences and geographic proximity, enhancing the overall user experience.
		With a focus on promoting informed decisions, encouraging shelter adoptions, simplifying the adoption process, and facilitating effective communication between adopters and shelters, PAWCARE aims to become a catalyst for responsible pet ownership and community engagement. The subsequent chapters delve into the existing and proposed systems, objectives, and the technological framework that underpins PAWCARE's functionality.
